## Runaway
{: .gloomfont}

She stood at the edge of the forest, her chest heaving, the first light of the rising sun just
beginning to bleed over the mountains behind her. The light of their torches flickered, casting
eerie shadows across their angry and accusing faces.

"Erecura." Natae stepped forward from the group, looking much too put together for having been
woken up in the middle of the night. "Stop this. Come back to the city."

Erecura's eyes scanned the mob before her as she struggled to catch her breath. Casseus cowered
behind Natae, too weak to face her himself. A new wave of anger and disgust washed over her, and a
sudden gust of wind blew through the trees, extinguising the Savvas' torches. Their surprised
faces were now lit only by the energy cores glowing in their chests.

Without a word, Erecura reached up and rested her hand on her chest. Dim green light spilled out
between her fingers. Taking one final steadying breath, she plunged her hand into her chest. There
was the sound of shattering glass, followed by a hollow thud as a glowing green orb hit the ground
and started to roll. Erecura watched, expressionless, as her energy core - the manifestation of her
power, the mark of her success as a Savvas - rolled down the hill, stopping with a light *thump*
at Natae's feet.

"Fool," Natae hissed. "Do you know what you've done? Without your energy core, you are *nothing*.
Now you are cursed, and forever exiled from your people."

"Then let me be cursed." Erecura turned from the Savvas, setting her gaze upon where the sun was
rising behind the mountains, and started to run.
